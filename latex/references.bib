  abstract = {We give a model for constructing an utility function u( ; d) in a dose prescription problem. and d denote respectively the patient state of health and the dose. The construction of u is based on the conditional probabilities of several variables. These probabilities are described by logistic models. Obviously, u is only an approximation of the true utility function and that is why we investigate the sensitivity of the nal decision with respect to the utility function. We construct a class of utility functions from u and approximate the set of all Bayes actions associated to that class. Then, we measure the sensitivity as the greatest di erence between the expected utilities of two Bayes actions. Finally, we apply these results to weighing up a chemotherapy treatment of lung cancer. This application emphasizes the importance of measuring robustness through the utility of decisions rather than the decisions themselves. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization provides sample-efficient global optimization for a broad range of applications, including automatic machine learning, engineering, physics, and experimental design. We introduce BOTORCH, a modern programming framework for Bayesian optimization that combines Monte-Carlo (MC) acquisition functions, a novel sample average approximation optimization approach, autodifferentiation, and variance reduction techniques. BOTORCH’s modular design facilitates flexible specification and optimization of probabilistic models written in PyTorch, simplifying implementation of new acquisition functions. Our approach is backed by novel theoretical convergence results and made practical by a distinctive algorithmic foundation that leverages fast predictive distributions, hardware acceleration, and deterministic optimization. We also propose a novel “one-shot” formulation of the Knowledge Gradient, enabled by a combination of our theoretical and software contributions. In experiments, we demonstrate the improved sample efficiency of BOTORCH relative to other popular libraries.},

  abstract = {Background: Most of the knowledge about the mechanisms of multidrug resistance in lung cancer has been achieved through the use of cell lines isolated from tumours cultivated either in suspensions of isolated cells or in monolayers and following exposition to different cytostatic agents. However, tumour cell lines growing as multicellular tumour spheroids (MTS) frequently develop multicellular resistance in a drug-independent form. The aim of this study was to characterize the phenotypic and functional differences between two human NSCLC cell lines (INER-37 and INER-51) grown as traditional monolayer cultures versus as MTS. Methods: After 72 hours treatment with anticancer drugs, chemosensitivity in monolayers and tumour spheroids cultures was assessed using MTT assay. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was employed to detect the mRNAs of multidrug resistance-related genes. The expression of P-gp was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining and cell cycle profiles were analyzed using FACS. Results: The results indicate that when grown as MTS each lung cancer cell line had different morphologies as well as and abrogation of cell proliferation with decrease of the G2/M phase. Also, MTS acquired multicellular resistance to several chemotherapeutic agents in only a few days of culture which were accomplished by significant changes in the expression of MDR-related genes. Conclusion: Overall, the MTS culture changed the cellular response to drugs nevertheless each of the cell lines studied seems to implement different mechanisms to acquire multicellular resistance.},

  abstract = {We consider parameter inference in cardio-mechanic models of the left ventricle, in particular the one based on the Holtzapfel-Ogden (HO) constitutive law, using clinical in vivo data. The equations underlying these models do not admit closed form solutions and hence need to be solved numerically. These numerical procedures are computationally expensive making computational run times associated with numerical optimisation or sampling excessive for the uptake of the models in the clinical practice. To address this issue, we adopt the framework of Bayesian optimisation (BO), which is an efficient statistical technique of global optimisation. BO seeks the optimum of an unknown black-box function by sequentially training a statistical surrogate-model and using it to select the next query point by leveraging the associated exploration-exploitation trade-off. To guarantee that the estimates based on the in vivo data are realistic also for high-pressures, unobservable in vivo, we include a penalty term based on a previously published empirical law developed using ex vivo data. Two case studies based on real data demonstrate that the proposed BO procedure outperforms the state-of-the-art inference algorithm for the HO constitutive law.},

  abstract = {Despite extensive efforts to unravel tumor behavior and develop anticancer therapies, most treatments fail when advanced to clinical trials. The main challenge in cancer research has been the absence of predictive cancer models, accurately mimicking the tumoral processes and response to treatments. The tumor microenvironment (TME) shows several human-specific physical and chemical properties, which cannot be fully recapitulated by the conventional 2D cell cultures or the               in vivo               animal models. These limitations have driven the development of novel               in vitro               cancer models, that get one step closer to the typical features of               in vivo               systems while showing better species relevance. This review introduces the main considerations required for developing and exploiting tumor spheroids and organoids as cancer models. We also detailed their applications in drug screening and personalized medicine. Further, we show the transition of these models into novel microfluidic platforms, for improved control over physiological parameters and high-throughput screening. 3D culture models have provided key insights into tumor biology, more closely resembling the               in vivo               TME and tumor characteristics, while enabling the development of more reliable and precise anticancer therapies.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of advancements in automated ligand screening, large-scale drug discovery remains resource-intensive and requires postprocessing hit selection, a step where chemists manually select a few promising molecules based on their chemical intuition. This creates a major bottleneck in the virtual screening process for drug discovery, demanding experts to repeatedly balance complex trade-offs among drug properties across a vast pool of candidates. To improve the efficiency and reliability of this process, we propose a novel human-centered framework named CheapVS that allows chemists to guide the ligand selection process by providing preferences regarding the trade-offs between drug properties via pairwise comparison. Our framework combines preferential multi-objective Bayesian optimization with a docking model for measuring binding affinity to capture human chemical intuition for improving hit identification. Specifically, on a library of 100K chemical candidates targeting EGFR and DRD2, CheapVS outperforms stateof-the-art screening methods in identifying drugs within a limited computational budget. Notably, our method can recover up to 16/37 EGFR and 37/58 DRD2 known drugs while screening only 6\% of the library, showcasing its potential to significantly advance drug discovery.},

  abstract = {Although biological agents have revolutionized the management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), a significant proportion of patients show primary non-response or develop secondary loss of response. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is advocated to maintain the efficacy of biologic agents. Reactive TDM can rationalize the management of primary non-response and secondary loss of response and has shown to be more cost-effective compared with empiric dose escalation. Proactive TDM is shown to increase clinical remission and the durability of the response to a biologic agent. However, the efficacy of proactive and reactive TDM has been questioned in recent studies and meta-analyses. Hence, we need a different approach to TDM, which addresses inflammatory burden, the individual patient, and disease factors. Bayesian approaches, which use population pharmacokinetic models, enable clinicians to make better use of TDM for dose adjustment. With rapid improvement in computer technology, these Bayesian model-based software packages are now available for clinical use. Bayesian dashboard systems allow clinicians to apply model-based dosing to understand an individual’s pharmacokinetics and achieve a target serum drug concentration. The model is updated using previously measured drug concentrations and relevant patient factors, such as body weight, C-reactive protein, and serum albumin concentration, to maintain effective drug concentrations in the serum. Initial studies have found utility for the Bayesian approach in induction and maintenance, in adult and pediatric patients, in clinical trials, and in real-life situations for patients with IBD treated with infliximab. This needs confirmation in larger studies. This article reviews the Bayesian approach to therapeutic drug monitoring in IBD.},

  abstract = {Individualised drug dosing has been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce adverse drug events. One method of individualised medicine is the Bayesian approach, which uses prior information about how the population responds to therapy, to inform clinicians about how a specific individual is responding to their current therapy. This information is then used to make changes to the dose. Studies using a Bayesian approach to adjust drug dosing have shown that clinicians are able to achieve a therapeutic range quicker than standard practice. If concentration is related to a pharmacodynamic end-point, this means that the drug will be more effective, and the side-effects will be minimised. Unfortunately, the software options to assist with Bayesian dosing in Australia are limited. The aims of this article are to demystify the concepts of Bayesian dosing, set the context of the Bayesian approach using reference to other dosing strategies and discuss its benefits over current dosing methods for a number of drugs. The article is targeted to medical and pharmacy clinicians, and there is a practical clinical case to demonstrate how this method could be used in everyday clinical practice.},

Extensive efforts have been dedicated to replicating the physical characteristics of tumor tissue by developing two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models. However, it remains a significant challenge to modulate the local microenvironment around the specific cells according to the culture progress. In this study, we develop a 3D culture platform for multicellular lung cancer spheroids using a gelatin-based hydrogel with adjustable density and stiffness. Then, by utilizing a two-photon mediated bioprinting technique, we construct 3D confining microstructures with micrometer accuracy to enclose the selected spheroids within the hydrogel matrix. Diverse transcriptional profilings of cells are observed in response to the increased ECM density and stiffness compared to the additional confining stress. In addition, changed confining stress can regulate the tumor cells with contrary impacts on the cell cycle-related pathways. Our model not only allows for modifications to the mechanical microenvironment of the overall matrix but also facilitates localized adjustments throughout the culture evolution. This approach serves as a valuable tool for investigating tumor progression and understanding cell-ECM interactions.},

  abstract = {Current cancer therapy includes a variety of strategies that can comprise only one type of treatment or a combination of multiple treatments. Chemotherapy is still the gold standard for cancer therapy, though sometimes associated with undesired side effects and the development of drug resistance. For this reason, drug combination is an approach that has been proposed to overcome the problems related to monotherapy and several studies have already demonstrated the superiority of combined therapies compared to monotherapy. The main goal when designing and evaluating drug combinations is to achieve synergistic effects by demonstrating that the combined effects are greatly superior to the expected from the additive effects of the single drugs, allowing for dosage reduction and therefore decreasing toxicity. Nevertheless, synergism quantification is not a simple task due to the different definitions of additivity and over the years several reference models have been proposed based on different assumptions and with different mathematical frameworks. In this review, we begin to cover the available treatment options for cancer therapy, with emphasis on the importance of drug combinations in cancer therapy. We next describe the classical reference models that have been proposed for synergism evaluation, usually classified as effect-based and dose-effect based methods, with a brief analysis of the current limitations of these models. We also describe here the novel methods for the accurate quantification of drug interactions in combined treatments. At the end of this manuscript, we covered some of the most recent preclinical and clinical combination studies that reflect the importance of the appropriate, accurate and precise application of the concepts and methodologies here described for the evaluation of synergism.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims: Accelerated infliximab (IFX) induction is often based on clinical parameters as opposed to pharmacokinetics (PK). We aimed to investigate the impact of dashboard-guided optimized induction dosing on IFX durability and immunogenicity in a real-world inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) setting. Methods: Pediatric and adult IBD patients were enrolled in a prospective single arm intervention trial. Cumulative data from each infusion (INF), weight, albumin, C-reactive protein, IFX dose, IFX trough level, and antidrug antibody presence were used to inform subsequent INF dosing. Forecasts driven by adaptive Bayesian modeling were generated to maintain trough levels for the third (INF3) and fourth (INF4) infusions of 17 μg/mL and 10 μg/mL, respectively. The primary outcome was proportion of patients prescribed accelerated dosing (AD) intervals by INF3 ({$<$}22 days) or INF4 ({$<$}49 days). Secondary outcomes included week 52 clinical and PK outcomes. Multivariate analyses and Kaplan-Meier curves compared outcomes based on adherence to dashboard forecasts. Results: Of the 180 per-protocol population, AD was forecast for 41\% (INF3) and 69\% (INF4) of patients with median intervals of 17 (INF3) and 39 (INF4) days. Baseline age {$>$}18 years, albumin {$>$}3.5 g/L, and 10-mg/kg dose were independently associated with lower rates of AD by INF4. Nonadherence with the INF4 forecast (n = 39) was an independent predictor of antidrug antibody (P {$<$} .0001) and IFX discontinuation (P = .0006).

  abstract = {Background and Aims: Accelerated infliximab (IFX) induction is often based on clinical parameters as opposed to pharmacokinetics (PK). We aimed to investigate the impact of dashboard-guided optimized induction dosing on IFX durability and immunogenicity in a real-world inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) setting. Methods: Pediatric and adult IBD patients were enrolled in a prospective single arm intervention trial. Cumulative data from each infusion (INF), weight, albumin, C-reactive protein, IFX dose, IFX trough level, and antidrug antibody presence were used to inform subsequent INF dosing. Forecasts driven by adaptive Bayesian modeling were generated to maintain trough levels for the third (INF3) and fourth (INF4) infusions of 17 μg/mL and 10 μg/mL, respectively. The primary outcome was proportion of patients prescribed accelerated dosing (AD) intervals by INF3 ({$<$}22 days) or INF4 ({$<$}49 days). Secondary outcomes included week 52 clinical and PK outcomes. Multivariate analyses and Kaplan-Meier curves compared outcomes based on adherence to dashboard forecasts. Results: Of the 180 per-protocol population, AD was forecast for 41\% (INF3) and 69\% (INF4) of patients with median intervals of 17 (INF3) and 39 (INF4) days. Baseline age {$>$}18 years, albumin {$>$}3.5 g/L, and 10-mg/kg dose were independently associated with lower rates of AD by INF4. Nonadherence with the INF4 forecast (n = 39) was an independent predictor of antidrug antibody (P {$<$} .0001) and IFX discontinuation (P = .0006). A total of 119 of 123 patients on IFX at week 52 were in steroid-free remission. Conclusions: The application of a PK dashboard during induction can optimize dosing early to improve IFX durability and immunogenicity.

Compared with labor-intensive conventional software for pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling (eg, NONMEM) dashboards are easy-to-use programs incorporating complex Bayesian statistics to determine individual pharmacokinetics. We evaluated various infliximab detection assays and the number of samples needed to precisely forecast individual SICs using a Bayesian dashboard.We assessed longterm infliximab retention in patients being dosed concordantly versus discordantly with Bayesian dashboard recommendations. Three hundred eightytwo serum samples from 117 adult IBD patients on infliximab maintenance therapy were analyzed by 3 commercially available assays. Data from each assay was modeled using NONMEM and a Bayesian dashboard. PK parameter precision and residual variability were assessed. Forecast concentrations from both systems were compared with observed concentrations. Infliximab retention was assessed by prediction for dose intensification via Bayesian dashboard versus real-life practice. Forecast precision of SICs varied between detection assays. At least 3 SICs from a reliable assay are needed for an accurate forecast. The Bayesian dashboard performed similarly to NONMEM to predict SICs. Patients dosed concordantly with Bayesian dashboard recommendations had a significantly longer median drug survival than those dosed discordantly (51.5 versus 4.6 months, P {$<$} .0001). The Bayesian dashboard helps to assess the diagnostic performance of infliximab detection assays. Three, not single, SICs provide sufficient information for individualized dose adjustment when incorporated into the Bayesian dashboard. Treatment adjusted to forecasted SICs is associated with longer drug retention of infliximab.},

By assessing changes in viability, confluency and spheroid size, we were able to identify readout- and culture format-independent synergies, as well as synergies specific to either culture format or readout method. In particular, we found that spheroids, compared to 2D cultures, were generally both more sensitive and showed greater synergistic response to combinations involving a MEK inhibitor. These results further shed light on the importance of including more complex culture models in order to increase the efficiency of drug discovery pipelines.},

Organoids-on-chip models combine organoid methods with powerful designing and fabrication of micro-chip technology. Organoid-chip models can emulate the dynamic microenvironment of tumor pathophysiology as well as tissue–tissue interactions.

To date, the development of data-driven experiment planning strategies for autonomous experimentation has largely focused on continuous process parameters despite the urge to devise efficient strategies for the selection of categorical variables. Here, we introduce Gryffin, a general purpose optimization framework for the autonomous selection of categorical variables driven by expert knowledge. Gryffin augments Bayesian optimization based on kernel density estimation with smooth approximations to categorical distributions. Leveraging domain knowledge in the form of physicochemical descriptors, Gryffin can significantly accelerate the search for promising molecules and materials. Gryffin can further highlight relevant correlations between the provided descriptors to inspire physical insights and foster scientific intuition. In addition to comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate the capabilities and performance of Gryffin on three examples in materials science and chemistry: (i) the discovery of non-fullerene acceptors for organic solar cells, (ii) the design of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites for light harvesting, and (iii) the identification of ligands and process parameters for Suzuki-Miyaura reactions. Our results suggest that Gryffin, in its simplest form, is competitive with state-of-the-art categorical optimization algorithms. However, when leveraging domain knowledge provided via descriptors, Gryffin outperforms other approaches while simultaneously refining this domain knowledge to promote scientific understanding.},

  abstract = {Model-based optimization strategies, such as Bayesian optimization (BO), have been deployed across the natural sciences in design and discovery campaigns due to their sample efficiency and flexibility. The combination of such strategies with automated laboratory equipment and/or high-performance computing in a suggest-make-measure closed-loop constitutes a self-driving laboratory (SDL), which have been endorsed as a next-generation technology for autonomous scientific experimentation. Despite the promise of early SDL prototypes, a lack of flexible experiment planning algorithms prevents certain prevalent optimization problem types from being addressed. For instance, many experiment planning algorithms are unable to intelligently deal with failed measurements resulting from a priori unknown constraints on the parameter space. Such constraint functions are pervasive in chemistry and materials science research, stemming from unexpected equipment failures, failed/abandoned syntheses, or unstable molecules or materials. In this work, we provide a comprehensive discussion and benchmark of BO strategies to deal with a priori unknown constraints, characterized by learning the constraint function on-the-fly using a variational Gaussian process classifier and combining its predictions with the typical BO regression surrogate to parameterize feasibility-aware acquisition functions. These acquisition functions balance sampling parameter space regions deemed to be promising in terms of optimization objectives with avoidance of regions predicted to be infeasible. In addition to benchmarking feasibility-aware acquisition functions on analytic optimization benchmark surfaces, we conduct two realistic optimization benchmarks derived from previously reported studies: inverse design of hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskite materials with unknown stability constraints, and the design of BCR-Abl kinase inhibitors with unknown synthetic accessibility constraints. We deliver intuitive recommendations to readers on which strategies work best for various scenarios. Overall, this work contributes to advancing the practicality and efficiency of autonomous experimentation in SDLs. All strategies introduced in this work are implemented as part of the open-source Atlas Python library.},

The usefulness of considering experimental and design constraints are shown in two simulated chemistry applications.           ,                             Optimization strategies driven by machine learning, such as Bayesian optimization, are being explored across experimental sciences as an efficient alternative to traditional design of experiment. When combined with automated laboratory hardware and high-performance computing, these strategies enable next-generation platforms for autonomous experimentation. However, the practical application of these approaches is hampered by a lack of flexible software and algorithms tailored to the unique requirements of chemical research. One such aspect is the pervasive presence of constraints in the experimental conditions when optimizing chemical processes or protocols, and in the chemical space that is accessible when designing functional molecules or materials. Although many of these constraints are known               a priori               , they can be interdependent, non-linear, and result in non-compact optimization domains. In this work, we extend our experiment planning algorithms PHOENICS and GRYFFIN such that they can handle arbitrary known constraints               via               an intuitive and flexible interface. We benchmark these extended algorithms on continuous and discrete test functions with a diverse set of constraints, demonstrating their flexibility and robustness.

Benefiting from the superior biocompatibility and electrical property of conductive hydrogel, together with cochlear implant EAS, the inner ear progenitor cells can proliferate and spontaneously shape into spheres, finally forming cochlear organoids with good cell viability and structurally mature hair cells. By incorporating these progenitor cells‐encapsulated hydrogels into a microfluidic‐based cochlea‐on‐a‐chip with culture chambers and a concentration gradient generator, a dynamic and high‐throughput evaluation of inner ear disease‐related drugs is demonstrated.

Buffer screening is the first stage of this formulation process that selects the promising combinations of buffer and excipients that can help maintain both the stability and efficacy of the drug. In this paper, we propose an interactive Bayesian Optimisation approach that streamlines the buffer screening process and reduces the number of experiments needed to identify an optimal combination of buffer and excipients. Our approach employs two novel formulations of the (multi-buffer) optimisation problem: (i) one that unifies all buffers into a single Bayesian Optimisation framework, and (ii) the other that performs meta-learning to aggregate important excipient information over multiple buffers, in order to predict the most promising buffer and excipients combination to sample next. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach can identify an optimal combination of buffer and excipients while minimising the number of experiments required, and demonstrate the potential of using Bayesian Optimisation to enhance the protein formulation process.},

  abstract = {Although the frequentist paradigm has been the predominant approach to clinical trial design since the 1940s, it has several notable limitations. Advancements in computational algorithms and computer hardware have greatly enhanced the alternative Bayesian paradigm. Compared with its frequentist counterpart, the Bayesian framework has several unique advantages, and its incorporation into clinical trial design is occurring more frequently. Using an extensive literature review to assess how Bayesian methods are used in clinical trials, we find them most commonly used for dose finding, efficacy monitoring, toxicity monitoring, diagnosis/decision making, and studying pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. The additional infrastructure required for implementing Bayesian methods in clinical trials may include specialized software programs to run the study design, simulation and analysis, and web‐based applications, all of which are particularly useful for timely data entry and analysis. Trial success requires not only the development of proper tools but also timely and accurate execution of data entry, quality control, adaptive randomization, and Bayesian computation. The relative merit of the Bayesian and frequentist approaches continues to be the subject of debate in statistics. However, more evidence can be found showing the convergence of the two camps, at least at the practical level. Ultimately, better clinical trial methods lead to more efficient designs, lower sample sizes, more accurate conclusions, and better outcomes for patients enrolled in the trials. Bayesian methods offer attractive alternatives for better trials. More Bayesian trials should be designed and conducted to refine the approach and demonstrate their real benefit in action.

  abstract = {High-content, high-throughput (HCHT) screening platforms are essential for drug discovery, yet conventional 2D assays lack physiological relevance, and current 3D spheroid systems often face challenges to scalability, uniformity, and the analytical efficiency required for statistically robust screening. Here, we present a fully integrated 3D HCHT platform that synergizes tumor spheroid arrays generated from a bioinert inverted colloidal crystal (iCC) hydrogel framework with an automated, high-speed image analysis pipeline for rapid and spatially resolved therapeutic profiling. The iCC framework enables spontaneous self-assembly of highly ordered tumor spheroid array at high spheroid density (∼79.8 spheroids·mm−2) with tight size uniformity ({$<$}10\% standard deviation), supporting reproducible and high-content imaging (∼40 spheroids·image−1). The automated imageprocessing algorithm achieves robust region-of-interest segmentation, fluorescenceweighted-spheroid centroiding (FwSC), and multiparametric spatial analysis in {$<$}5 s per image�markedly faster than well-plate analysis (e.g., ∼5 min per 96-well plate) or sequential single-spheroid analysis methods (∼1 s per spheroid). Using this platform, we capture dose-dependent diffusion of doxorubicin, tumor penetration profile of small extracellular vesicles, and cell-type-specific infiltration behaviors of monocytes versus macrophages. Comparative viability profiling across chemotherapeutics further reveals distinct spatial toxicity signatures, highlighting the importance of spatial context in drug response assessment. Collectively, this platform enables rapid, reproducible, and spatially informative screening in 3D, offering a powerful tool for drug discovery, tumor modeling, and immunotherapeutic development.},

  abstract = {Enhanced drug testing efficiency has driven the prominence of high‐content and high‐throughput screening (HCHTS) in drug discovery and development. However, traditional HCHTS in well‐plates often lack complexity of in\,vivo conditions. 3D cell cultures, like cellular spheroids/organoids, offer a promising alternative by replicating in\,vivo conditions and improving the reliability of drug responses. Integrating spheroids/organoids into HCHTS requires strategies to ensure uniform formation, systemic function, and compatibility with analysis techniques. This study introduces an easy‐to‐fabricate, low‐cost, safe, and scalable approach to create a bioinert hydrogel‐based inverted colloidal crystal (BhiCC) framework for uniform and high‐yield spheroid cultivation. Highly uniform alginate microgels are fabricated and assembled into a colloidal crystal template with controllable contact area, creating engineered void spaces and interconnecting channels within agarose‐based BhiCC through the template degradation by alginate lyase and buffer. This results in a multi‐layered iCC domain, enabling the generation of in‐vitro 3D culture models with over 1000 spheroids per well in a 96‐well plate. The unique hexagonal‐close‐packed geometry of iCC structure enables HCHTS through conventional plate reader analysis and fluorescent microscopy assisted by house‐developed automated data processing algorithm. This advancement offers promising applications in tissue engineering, disease modeling, and drug development in biomedical research.},

However, the limited amount of organoids available for each case as well as the considerable amount of time and cost to expand in vitro makes it impractical to perform high‐throughput drug screening using organoid cultures from multiple patients. Here, we report an advanced system for the high‐throughput screening of 2427 drugs using the cancer tissue‐originated spheroid (               CTOS               ) method.

In recent years, high-throughput screening (HTS) in 3D cell arrays has been extensively used for drug discovery because of its usability and applicability. Herein, we developed a microfluidic spheroid culture device (µFSCD) with a concentration gradient generator (CGG) that enabled cells to form spheroids and grow in the presence of cancer drug gradients. The device is composed of concave microwells with several serpentine micro-channels which generate a concentration gradient. Once the colon cancer cells (HCT116) formed a single spheroid (approximately 120 µm in diameter) in each microwell, spheroids were perfused in the presence of the cancer drug gradient irinotecan for three days. The number of spheroids, roundness, and cell viability, were inversely proportional to the drug concentration. These results suggest that the µFSCD with a CGG has the potential to become an HTS platform for screening the efficacy of cancer drugs.},

Establishing a controllable, biomimetic, and large-scale analytical platform to investigate the tumor-associated pathophysiological and preclinical events, such as oncogenesis and chemotherapy, is necessary. Methods and Results: This study presents antitumor investigation in a parallel, largescale, and tissue-mimicking manner based on well-constructed chemical gradients and heterotypic three-dimensional (3D) tumor cocultures using a multifunctionintegrated device. The integrated microfluidic device was engineered to produce a controllable and steady chemical gradient by manipulative optimization. Array-like and size-homogeneous production of heterotypic 3D tumor cocultures with in vivolike features, including similar tumor-stromal composition and functional phenotypic gradients of metabolic activity and viability, was successfully established. Furthermore, temporal, parallel, and high-throughput analyses of tumor behaviors in different antitumor stimulations were performed in a device based on the integrated operations involving gradient generation and coculture. Conclusion: This achievement holds great potential for applications in the establishment of multifunctional tumor platforms to perform tissue-biomimetic neoplastic research and therapy assessment in the fields of oncology, bioengineering, and drug discovery.},

A major limitation in the development of new therapies is the prediction of drug efficacy using               in vitro               models. Classic               in vitro               2-dimensional (2D) cell monolayer cultures are hypersensitive to anti-cancer drugs. As a result, there has been a surge in the development of platforms that enable three dimensional (3D) cultures thought to better replicate natural physiology and better predict drug efficacy. A deficiency associated with most 3D culture systems is that their complexity reduces the number of replicates and combination therapies that can be feasibly evaluated. Herein, we describe the use of a microwell platform that utilises a nylon mesh to retain 3D micro-tumours in discrete microwells; termed the               Microwell-mesh               . The Microwell-mesh enables the manufacture of \textasciitilde 150 micro-tumours per well in a 48-well plate, and response to anti-tumour drugs can be readily quantified. Our results demonstrate that 3D micro-tumours, unlike 2D monolayers, are not hypersensitive to Docetaxel or Abiraterone Acetate, providing a superior platform for the evaluation of sequential drug treatment. In summary, the Microwell-mesh provides an efficient 3D micro-tumour platform for single and sequential drug screening.},

The trial involves three important decisions, adaptive dose allocation, optimal stopping of the trial, and the optimal terminal decision upon stopping. For all three decisions we use a formal Bayesian decision-theoretic approach. The application demonstrates how Bayesian posterior inference and decision-theoretic approaches combine to provide a coherent solution in a complex application. The main challenges are the need for a flexible probability model for the unknown dose-response curve, a delayed response, the sequential nature of the stopping decision, and the complex considerations involved in the terminal decision.

  abstract = {A novel microfluidics platform is introduced for generating tumoroids in droplets, enabling effective drug screening of chemotherapies on both cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenografts.           ,                             3D               in vitro               biological systems are progressively replacing 2D systems to increase the physiological relevance of cellular studies. Microfluidics-based approaches can be powerful tools towards such biomimetic systems, but often require high-end complicated and expensive processes and equipment for microfabrication. Herein, a drug screening platform is proposed, minimizing technicality and manufacturing steps. It provides an alternate way of spheroid generation in droplets in tubes. Droplet microfluidics then elicit multiple droplets merging events at programmable times, to submit sequentially the spheroids to chemotherapy and to reagents for cytotoxicity screening. After a comprehensive study of tumorogenesis within the droplets, the system is validated for drug screening (IC               50               ) with chemotherapies in cancer cell lines as well as cells from a patient-derived-xenografts (PDX). As compared to microtiter plates methods, our system reduces the initial number of cells up to 10 times and opens new avenues towards primary tumors drug screening approaches.},

However, inconsistent and low-throughput spheroid production has hindered their application in drug screening. Here, we present an automated high-throughput platform for a spheroid selection, fabrication, and sorting system (SFSS) to produce uniform gelatine-encapsulated spheroids (GESs) with high efficiency. SFSS integrates advanced imaging, analysis, photo-triggered fabrication, and microfluidic sorting to precisely control spheroid size, shape, and viability. Our data demonstrate that our SFSS can produce over 50 GESs with consistent size and circularity in 30 min with over 97\% sorting accuracy while maintaining cell viability and structural integrity. We demonstrated that the GESs can be used for drug screening and potentially for various assays. Thus, the SFSS could significantly enhance the efficiency of generating uniform spheroids, facilitating their application in drug development to investigate complex biological systems and drug responses in a more physiologically relevant context.},

Interstitial flow strongly impacts tumor response to chemotherapy; however, conventional in vitro cancer models largely disregard this key feature. Here, a proof of principle microfluidic platform for the generation of large arrays of breast tumor spheroids that are grown under close‐to‐physiological flow in a biomimetic hydrogel is reported. This cancer spheroids‐on‐a‐chip model is used for time‐ and labor‐efficient studies of the effects of drug dose and supply rate on the chemosensitivity of breast tumor spheroids. The capability to grow large arrays of tumor spheroids from patient‐derived cells of different breast cancer subtypes is shown, and the correlation between in vivo drug efficacy and on‐chip spheroid drug response is demonstrated. The proposed platform can serve as an in vitro preclinical model for the development of personalized cancer therapies and effective screening of new anticancer drugs.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization (BO) with Gaussian processes (GP) has become an indispensable algorithm for black box optimization problems. Not without a dash of irony, BO is often considered a black box itself, lacking ways to provide reasons as to why certain parameters are proposed to be evaluated. This is particularly relevant in human-in-the-loop applications of BO, such as in robotics. We address this issue by proposing ShapleyBO, a framework for interpreting BO's proposals by game-theoretic Shapley values.They quantify each parameter's contribution to BO's acquisition function. Exploiting the linearity of Shapley values, we are further able to identify how strongly each parameter drives BO's exploration and exploitation for additive acquisition functions like the confidence bound. We also show that ShapleyBO can disentangle the contributions to exploration into those that explore aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Moreover, our method gives rise to a ShapleyBO-assisted human machine interface (HMI), allowing users to interfere with BO in case proposals do not align with human reasoning. We demonstrate this HMI's benefits for the use case of personalizing wearable robotic devices (assistive back exosuits) by human-in-the-loop BO. Results suggest human-BO teams with access to ShapleyBO can achieve lower regret than teams without.},

  abstract = {Lung malignancies accounted for 11\% of cancers worldwide in 2020 and remained the leading cause of cancer deaths. About 80\% of lung cancers belong to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is characterized by extremely high clonal and morphological heterogeneity of tumors and development of multidrug resistance. The improvement of current therapeutic strategies includes several directions. First, increasing knowledge in cancer biology results in better understanding of the mechanisms underlying malignant transformation, alterations in signal transduction, and crosstalk between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment, including immune cells. In turn, it leads to the discovery of important molecular targets in cancer development, which might be affected pharmaceutically. The second direction focuses on the screening of novel drug candidates, synthetic or from natural sources. Finally, “personalization” of a therapeutic strategy enables maximal damage to the tumor of a patient. The personalization of treatment can be based on the drug screening performed using patient-derived tumor xenografts or in vitro patient-derived cell models. 3D multicellular cancer spheroids, generated from cancer cell lines or tumor-isolated cells, seem to be a helpful tool for the improvement of current NSCLC therapies. Spheroids are used as a tumor-mimicking in vitro model for screening of novel drugs, analysis of intercellular interactions, and oncogenic cell signaling. Moreover, several studies with tumor-derived spheroids suggest this model for the choice of “personalized” therapy. Here we aim to give an overview of the different applications of NSCLC spheroids and discuss the potential contribution of the spheroid model to the development of anticancer strategies.},

This proposed work is a new hybrid model that enhances drug safety prescriptions by taking into account individual patient features and drug interactions. It does this by hybrid attention mechanisms with Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT), which employs Bayesian statistical thinking instead of the dot-product approach. This approach is driven by the growing complexity of patient profiles and the limitations of current algorithms, which often fail to dynamically change the relevance of individual aspects. This method seeks 94\% accuracy, effectively prioritizing safer drug combinations and personalizing drug recommendations. This integration leads to more consistent and customized drug prescriptions, which ultimately improve patient outcomes and advance the field of personalized healthcare.},

However, previously reported single-cell drug screening lacked multiple-dose concentration gradient studies, which limits their ability to predict drug performance accurately. To solve this problem, we constructed a multiconcentration gradient generator in which a Tai Chi-spiral mixer can accelerate solution mixing in a short time and produce a linear concentration gradient. Later, a gradient generator combined with a single-cell capture array was adopted to investigate the effects of single or combined doses of 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin on human hepatoma cells and human breast carcinoma cells (at the single-cell level). The results showed that both drugs were effective in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells, and the combination was more effective for human hepatoma cells. In addition, the relationship between the biomechanical heterogeneity (e.g., deformability and size) of tumor cells and potential drug resistance at the single-cell level was investigated, indicating that small and/or deformable cells were more resistant than large and/or less deformable cells. The device provides a simple and reliable platform for studying the optimal dosage of different drug candidates at the single-cell level and effectively screening single-agent chemotherapy regimens and combination therapies.},

Although many treatment methods are currently available, there is no simple and effective system for promptly conducting anti-cancer drug screening and dose-response evaluation of the cancer patients to the drug. Herein, we developed an easy and compact flow rate independent microfluidic chip that can rapidly construct three concentration gradients of multiple solutes based on Dean flow under a wide range of flow rates. Chemical gradient dynamics were investigated systematically and quantitatively. Three stable, accurate, and controllable drug gradients were generated to evaluate treatments of two tumor cell lines (MCF-7 and HepG2). Results showed the dose- and time-dependent antitumor effects of the drugs, indicating the suitability of the proposed system to evaluate the individual actions and interactions of the anti-cancer drugs (doxorubicin and cisplatin) on one tumor cell line under the same conditions. In addition, cell viability in the microfluidic chip under gradient conditions showed a linear relationship to the viability of the traditional culture experiment. In summary, our microfluidic device can be used to develop insensitive techniques to operational conditions for simultaneously establishing multi-drug concentration gradients, which has the potential to promote the development of specific drug screening tools for targeting multiple vulnerabilities of tumor cells and evaluating the most effective personalized treatment technique.},

Proactive dosing strategies to achieve and maintain predefined IFX trough levels (TL) may prevent LOR. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of dashboard driven IFX dosing compared to standard dosing in a prospective trial in IBD patients. Methods: In this multicentre 1:1 ‘PRECISION’ trial, we randomized IBD patients in clinical remission (Harvey Bradshaw Index 4 for Crohn’s disease (CD) or a partial Mayo score 2 for ulcerative colitis (UC)) receiving IFX maintenance treatment. The precision group (PG) received IFX dosing guided by a Bayesian pharmacokinetic model, aiming to achieve and maintain a TL of 3 mg/ml by treatment (de)escalation as indicated by the dashboard. Patients in the control group (CG) continued treatment without dose adaptations. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in sustained clinical remission after 1 year. Results: Eighty patients were enrolled (66 CD, 14 UC), and the median [interquartile range] age was 37 years [27–51]). After one year, 28/32 (88\%) of patients in the PG were in sustained clinical remission versus 25/39 (64\%) in the CG (p ¼ .017). PG patients had lower median faecal calprotectin levels after 1 year (p ¼ .031), whereas no significant differences in median CRP levels were found. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the use of a Bayesian dashboard for IFX dosing in maintenance treatment for IBD reduced the incidence of LOR compared to standard dosing. Precision dosing also resulted in lower FCP levels.},

  abstract = {Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices are broadly used for research in the life sciences and diagnostics and represent a very fast moving field. LOC devices are designed, prototyped and assembled using numerous strategies and materials but some fundamental trends are that these devices typically need to be (1) sealed, (2) supplied with liquids, reagents and samples, and (3) often interconnected with electrical or microelectronic components. In general, closing and connecting to the outside world these miniature labs remain a challenge irrespectively of the type of application pursued. Here, we review methods for sealing and connecting LOC devices using standard approaches as well as recent state-of-the-art methods. This review provides easy-to-understand examples and targets the microtechnology/engineering community as well as researchers in the life sciences.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Cardiovascular disease morbidity has increased worldwide. Organs‐on‐chips and human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) technologies aid to overcome some of the limitations in cardiac in vitro models. Here, a bi‐compartmental, monolithic heart‐on‐chip device that facilitates porous membrane integration in a single fabrication step is presented. Moreover, the device includes open‐top compartments that allow facile co‐culture of hPSC‐derived cardiomyocytes and human adult cardiac fibroblast into geometrically defined cardiac microtissues. The device can be reversibly closed with a glass seal or a lid with fully customized 3D‐printed pyrolytic carbon electrodes allowing electrical stimulation of cardiac microtissues. A subjacent microfluidic channel allowed localized and dynamic drug administration to the cardiac microtissues, as demonstrated by a chronotropic response to isoprenaline. Moreover, the microfluidic channel can also be populated with human induced pluripotent stem‐derived endothelial cells allowing co‐culture of heterotypic cardiac cells in one device. Overall, this study demonstrates a novel heart‐on‐chip model that systematically integrates an open‐top device with a 3D printed carbon electrode for electrical pacing and culture of cardiac tissues while enabling active perfusion and dynamic drug dosing. Advances in the engineering of human heart‐on‐chip models represent an important step towards making organ‐on‐a‐chip technology a routine aspect of preclinical cardiac drug development.},

The situation considered is quite specific: a fixed number of patients are available, to be treated one at a time, with the choice of dose for any patient requiring knowledge of the responses of all previous patients. A continuous range of possible doses is available. The prior beliefs about the dose-response relationship are of a particular form and the gain from investigation is measured in terms of statistical information gathered. How all of these specificationsmay be varied is discussed. A comparison with the continual reassessment method is made.},

  abstract = {Identification of optimal dose combinations in early-phase dose-finding trials is challenging, due to the trade-off between precisely estimating the many parameters required to flexibly model the possibly nonmonotonic dose-response surface, and the small sample sizes in early-phase trials. This difficulty is even more pertinent in the context of personalized dose-finding, where patient characteristics are used to identify tailored optimal dose combinations. To overcome these challenges, we propose the use of Bayesian optimization for finding optimal dose combinations in standard (one size fits all) and personalized multiagent dose-finding trials. Bayesian optimization is a method for estimating the global optima of expensiveto-evaluate objective functions. The objective function is approximated by a surrogate model, commonly a Gaussian process, paired with a sequential design strategy to select the next point via an acquisition function. This work is motivated by an industry-sponsored problem, where the focus is on optimizing a dual-agent therapy in a setting featuring minimal toxicity. To compare the performance of the standard and personalized methods under this setting, simulation studies are performed for a variety of scenarios. Our study concludes that taking a personalized approach is highly beneficial in the presence of heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Microfluidic concentration gradient generators are useful in drug testing, drug screening, and other cellular applications to avoid manual errors, save time, and labor. However, expensive fabrication techniques make such devices prohibitively costly. Here, in the present work, we developed a microfluidic concentration gradient generator (μCGG) using a recently proposed non-conventional photolithography-less method. In this method, ceramic suspension fluid was shaped into a square mesh by controlling Saffman Taylor instability in a multiport lifted Hele–Shaw cell (MLHSC). Using the shaped ceramic structure as the template, μCGG was prepared by soft lithography. The concentration gradient was characterized and effect of the flow rates was studied using COMSOL simulations. The simulation result was further validated by creating a fluorescein dye (fluorescein isothiocanate) gradient in the fabricated μCGG. To demonstrate the use of this device for drug testing, we created various concentrations of an anticancer drug—curcumin—using the device and determined its inhibitory concentration on cervical cancer cell-line HeLa. We found that the IC50 of curcumin for HeLa matched well with the conventional multi-well drug testing method. This method of μCGG fabrication has multiple advantages over conventional photolithography such as: (i) the channel layout and inlet-outlet arrangements can be changed by simply wiping the ceramic fluid before it solidifies, (ii) it is cost effective, (iii) large area patterning is easily achievable, and (iv) the method is scalable. This technique can be utilized to achieve a broad range of concentration gradient to be used for various biological and non-biological applications.},

Here, we integrated machine learning, automation, and large microfluidic arrays of cancer spheroids or patient-derived organoids formed in a tissue-mimetic hydrogel to achieve notable acceleration of the discovery of effective multidrug administration regimens. For the clinically approved drug combination, we found a sequential administration regimen leading to a substantial reduction in the total drug dose, in comparison with concurrent drug supply, both at comparable drug efficacy. For the drugs that are currently under clinical development, we found a synergistic effect of concurrently administered drugs and showed that the synergy diminishes for the sequential drug supply. The developed strategy holds promise for the discovery of effective combination therapies for advanced cancer treatment, including personalized chemotherapies.           ,              Drug administration regimens in combination therapies were found using patient-derived cancer organoids and machine learning.},

Still, most of the current microphysiological platforms are limited in closed designs, i.e. are not accessible after 3D cell culture loading. Here, we report an open-top microfluidic chip which enables the generation of two sequentially loaded 3D cell cultures without physical barriers restricting the nurture, gas exchange and cellular communication. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated the formation of two 3D vasculatures, one in the upper and the other in the lower compartment, under three distinct flow conditions:               asymmetric side-to-center               ,               symmetric side-to-center               and               symmetric center-to-side               . We used computational modelling to characterize initial flow pressures in cell culture compartments. We showed prominent vessel formation and branched vasculatures in upper and lower cell culture compartments with interconnecting, lumenized vessels with in vivo-relevant diameter in all flow conditions. With advanced image processing, we quantified and compared the overall vascular network volume and the total length formed in               asymmetric side-to-center               ,               symmetric side-to-center               and               symmetric center-to-side               flow conditions. Our results indicate that the developed chip can house two distinct 3D cell cultures with merging vessels between compartments and by providing               asymmetric side-to-center               or               symmetric center-to-side               flow vascular morphogenesis is enhanced in terms of overall network length. The developed open-top microfluidic chip may find various applications in generation of tissue-specific 3D-3D co-cultures for studying cellular interactions in vascularized tissues and organs.},
